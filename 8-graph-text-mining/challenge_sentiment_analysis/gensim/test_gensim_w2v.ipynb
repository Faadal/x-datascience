but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up for a few laughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film s expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesn t even qualify as a so bad it s good movie it s just plain bad very very bad here s why look away if you re spoilerphobic the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you don t want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra evil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish i e hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that he d watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot hole related questions was explained in the minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact i m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didn t hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit inducing hour the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes i ll just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is snakes yay oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead before any snakes even appear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans that s an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that we ve met the cast let s watch all of them die except of course the cute kids don t expect anything original it s just snake bites on various and ever increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film makers obviously didn t use theirs br br so that s most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice cool sammy included but wait we re not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jackson s hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much needed u turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience years ago let alone in would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the film br br actually we re not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia it s time for good guy and hero to get it on in bali nope it wasn t at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times that s it this is the first time i ve ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel l jackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please don t see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you ll never want to come into contact

       " 'office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right

       " 'within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently elicit interest were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g wells classic the time machine the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in thrall is that of invisibility which sparks the imagination with it s seemingly endless and myriad possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g wells classic the invisible man the realization of which here is hollow man directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue br br sebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s government exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility which they have at last achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being it s a problem however that caine after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project br br at the last minute though caine demurs fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they ve been given approval by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it s too late it all begins to take a toll on caine s mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that now there s a very real chance that he may lose everything including himself br br verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he s worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine s suffering and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it s inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and it s a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower br br kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoeven s purposes perfectly there s little depth to bacon s portrayal but it has more to do with his director s agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza br br elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay caine s willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment but it s basically a thankless part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of shue s caliber the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the film things behind the sun her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and f x both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with here br br the supporting cast includes josh brolin matthew greg grunberg carter joey slotnick frank mary randle janice and

main character s internal turmoil does not work at all in vonnegut s book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hill s adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots br br a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesn t like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesn t like change don t ask me br br possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of one br br on the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast br br so now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann s he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter s ribbons without getting sooty the least bit br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story br br one might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance',\n",
